### Manual Testing 

* The website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera browsers.
* The website was viewed on a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, and a variety of mobile phones, such as Samsung Galaxy A52.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure links between pages are working correctly on all pages.
* Family and friends were asked to review the website for a better understanding of the user experience.
* Family and friends were asked to play the quiz and give feedback.
* Dev Tools was used to test how the site looks on various screen sizes.
* Dev Tools Console was used to find any bugs that were not spotted.
* Dev Tools Application's local storage used to track is the code functioning as intended.
* Manually navigating to specific HTML pages by typing the URL of the page and checking the console and local storage.
* JSHint was used to check quality of the code and any errors missed by the developer.

### Fixed Bugs

* By manually navigating to specific HTML pages by typing the URL of the page and checking the console and local storage
* By manually navigating to quiz-end.html there was a bug displaying null value of the username and score variables that were stored it the local storage.
* Bug was fixed with window.location.href, if a user tries to navigate to the quiz-end.html manually it redirects them to the index.html page because they didin't play the quiz yet.
* The code checks if the mostRecentScore is -1 and that is how it triggers the redirect to index.html page
* If somebody decided to clear all key, value properties from the local storage they still would not be able to start the quiz.
* The website is protected from users starting the game without a username.
